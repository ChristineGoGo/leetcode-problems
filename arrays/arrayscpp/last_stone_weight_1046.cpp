/*

    You are given an array of integers stones where
    stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

    We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn,
    we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together.
    Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with
    x <= y. The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone
    of weight y has new weight y - x.
    At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

    Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.



    Example 1:

    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
    we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
    Example 2:

    Input: stones = [1]
    Output: 1


    Constraints:

    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// APPROACH: Create new vector to store the new converted numbers.Sort stones.
// recursively loop through adding converted numbers into the new vector
// loop through the converted vector once more until only 1 stone is left
int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
    int n = stones.size();
    // base case
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return n == 0 ? 0 : stones[0];
    }

    stable_sort(stones.begin(), stones.end());

    int bigger = stones[n - 1];
    int biggerNext = stones[n -2];
    int diff = bigger - biggerNext;

    stones.pop_back();
    stones.pop_back();
    stones.push_back(diff);

    return lastStoneWeight(stones);
